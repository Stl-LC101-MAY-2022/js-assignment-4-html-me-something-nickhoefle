         <h2>The Trip</h2>
         <p>In 2008, I had the opportunity to visit Yellowstone Park. A last minute cancellation led to me joining a friend's family vacation. The trip was awe-inspiring. The landscape was full of breathtaking views, mountains, lakes, wildflowers, megafauna, and more. While I am not the most traveled person, it is far and away the most amazing place I have visited. Our mode of transportation was a Ford Explorer with an RV hitched to it, and we logged almost 3,000 miles in total. To anyone reading this: if you have not visited, you must!</p>
